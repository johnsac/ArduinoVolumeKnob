# ArduinoVolumeKnob
Arduino code to move stepper motor based on input from IR remote.  The goal is to use a rubber band or o-ring to move a volume knob for a speaker system that cannot otherwise be controlled with a remote control.

This code is mostly taken from http://rapidcitizen.com/arduino_remote_stereo_volume_control.html

The following components are needed for this build:
Arduino Uno R3 (Atmega328 - assembled) - Main Arduino board
Adafruit Motor/Stepper/Servo Shield for Arduino v2 Kit - v2.3 - Motor control board
Small Reduction Stepper Motor - 5VDC 32-Step 1/16 Gearing - Stepper motor
Aluminum GT2 Timing Pulley - 6mm Belt - 20 Tooth - 5mm Bore - Pulley for motor
IR sensor - TSOP38238 - IR sensor to receive the remote signal
9 VDC 1000mA regulated switching power adapter - Power supply
